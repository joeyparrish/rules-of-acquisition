# Print Your Own Rules On Business Cards

Here you will find images suitable for printing your favorite rules on business
cards.  Services like [MOO](https://www.moo.com/us/business-cards/original)
will allow you to print a set of business cards with different things on each,
and the images in this folder fit their design guidelines perfectly.

These are designed for a standard 3.5" x 2" US business card at 300 DPI, with a
bleed area of 3.66" x 2.16" and a safe zone of 3.34" x 1.84" as specified by
MOO's template.

Simply upload the [front image](front.png) and your favorite 50 rules from
[the backs folder](backs/) and they will print them for you.  The going rate
as of 2025-08 is $22 for a set of 50.

If you're a completionist, you can place 3 orders to get all 133 rules!
